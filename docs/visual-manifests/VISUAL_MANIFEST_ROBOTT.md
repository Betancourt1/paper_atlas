# Visual manifest — RoboTTT: Context Scaling for Robot Policies

- Paper ID: `paper_robott`
- Exact paper version: `v1`
- Explainer fixture: `packages/test-fixtures/explainers/robott.json`
- Manifest revision: `8`
- Engineer status: `COMPLETE`
- Implementer status: `COMPLETE`
- Paragraph coverage: `16 / 16` prose paragraphs
- Paragraph-ID derivation: `{block.id}_p{1-based index in block.paragraphs}`; each fixture paragraph appears exactly once.
- Evidence sources:
  - `rttt_architecture_source` — RoboTTT v1 — architecture and sequence training; Sections 2–3.2, Equations 1–5, Figures 2–4, PDF pages 3–5; the arXiv v1 record identifies the paper as CC BY 4.0
  - `rttt_training_source` — RoboTTT v1 — context learning and DAgger Distillation; Sections 3.3–3.4, Figures 5–6, PDF pages 6–7
  - `rttt_results_source` — RoboTTT v1 — real-robot evaluation and ablations; Section 4, Tables 1–3, Figures 7–12, PDF pages 7–11
  - `rttt_limits_source` — RoboTTT v1 — limitations, deployment, and evaluation details; Section 6 and Appendices A–B, PDF pages 12 and 20–22

Revision 8 retains the paragraph-level source audit and adds a mandatory narrow-screen inspection contract for every reused original: readable intrinsic width, keyboard-accessible horizontal inspection, a visible mobile hint, contained overflow, unaltered source pixels, and preserved provenance.

## `rttt_why_p1`

- Location: `rttt_why`, paragraph 1
- Text anchor: "A robot acting for minutes must remember which stages it has completed, what actions"
- Claims and sources: `rttt_core`, `rttt_architecture`, `rttt_architecture_source`
- Visual needed: `NO`
- Complexity warrant: NONE — prose is sufficient.
- Forbidden-structure audit: `NO_VISUAL`
- Source-figure audit: `NO_MATCH`
- Original figure locator: `NONE`
- License and reuse status: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — The paper's figures were checked; none directly performs this paragraph's explanatory job.
- Decision rationale: The paragraph makes one bounded distinction in plain language: A robot acting for minutes must remember which stages it has completed, what actions failed, and what was previously visible before an object became occluded. A visual would repeat that statement as a stock chain, list, or set of cards rather than reduce genuine mental reconstruction.
- Explanatory job: Motivation and problem framing.

### Implementation record

- Status: `NOT_NEEDED`
- Selected treatment: `NONE`
- Selection rationale: `NO_VISUAL` — prose is the approved treatment.
- Delivery medium: `NONE`
- Visual ID and placement: `NONE` — `NO_VISUAL`
- Shared paragraph scope: `NONE`
- Changed files: `NONE`
- Accessibility and fallback verification: `NO_VISUAL`
- Desktop and mobile verification: `NO_VISUAL`
- Evidence deviations: `NONE`

## `rttt_why_p2`

- Location: `rttt_why`, paragraph 2
- Text anchor: "Full attention over an ever-growing history makes each new prediction more expensive. A compact"
- Claims and sources: `rttt_core`, `rttt_architecture`, `rttt_architecture_source`
- Visual needed: `NO`
- Complexity warrant: NONE — prose is sufficient.
- Forbidden-structure audit: `NO_VISUAL`
- Source-figure audit: `NO_MATCH`
- Original figure locator: `NONE`
- License and reuse status: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — The paper's figures were checked; none directly performs this paragraph's explanatory job.

## `rttt_change_p1`

- Location: `rttt_change`, paragraph 1
- Text anchor: "RoboTTT does not keep the complete history available for attention. It uses fast weights"
- Claims and sources: `rttt_architecture`, `rttt_training`, `rttt_architecture_source`
- Visual needed: `YES`
- Complexity warrant: Non-trivial source-figure relationship — RoboTTT architecture and long-context fast-weight update topology; prose would force readers to reconstruct the figure's linked components or quantitative structure.
- Forbidden-structure audit: `PASS`
- Source-figure audit: `USE_ORIGINAL`
- Original figure locator: Figure 2, PDF page 4, `rttt_architecture_source`
- License and reuse status: `PERMITTED` — The arXiv v1 record identifies CC BY 4.0, while the PDF also carries an NVIDIA copyright notice; use the arXiv-licensed asset and preserve both the attribution and this recorded notice conflict.
- Decision rationale: The original figure directly performs this paragraph's explanatory job. Displaying it materially reduces reconstruction, while replacing it with a custom redraw would discard evidence-bearing structure and violate the source-first rule.
- Explanatory job: Method distinction and scope.

### Treatment A — Full original with focus frame

- Teaching purpose: Preserve the complete source figure and add one focus frame around the portion that answers this paragraph.
- Encoding and reading order: Read the untouched original first; the focus frame identifies the relevant region without suppressing its surrounding context.
- Evidence and limitations: Uses Figure 2, PDF page 4, `rttt_architecture_source`. It preserves the original source asset and may annotate only RoboTTT architecture and long-context fast-weight update topology; callouts add no new quantities, topology, or causal claims.
- Primary delivery medium: `source asset`
- Recommended web medium: `source asset`
- Mobile, accessibility, and motion behavior: Keep the source asset unaltered at a readable intrinsic width inside a simple horizontally inspectable viewport on narrow screens. Make the viewport keyboard-focusable with a visible focus indicator and support horizontal inspection by arrow keys; show a visible mobile hint: “Swipe or use arrow keys to inspect the original figure.” Contain all horizontal overflow inside the figure viewport so the page itself never scrolls sideways. Preserve the original caption, exact locator, attribution, license, and equivalent text explanation. No motion.

```

### Treatment B — Original detail with context inset

- Teaching purpose: Show a legible detail while retaining the complete original as a context inset.
- Encoding and reading order: Read the enlarged source detail first, then use the inset to recover its exact position in the unmodified original.
- Evidence and limitations: Uses Figure 2, PDF page 4, `rttt_architecture_source`. It preserves the original source asset and may annotate only RoboTTT architecture and long-context fast-weight update topology; callouts add no new quantities, topology, or causal claims.
- Primary delivery medium: `source asset`
- Recommended web medium: `source asset`
- Mobile, accessibility, and motion behavior: Keep the source asset unaltered at a readable intrinsic width inside a simple horizontally inspectable viewport on narrow screens.

### Treatment C — Original with numbered reading key

- Teaching purpose: Keep the complete source figure and overlay a small numbered key that explains its paper-specific relationships.
- Encoding and reading order: Read the source figure in its own order; numbered callouts identify the evidence-bearing marks without redrawing them.
- Evidence and limitations: Uses Figure 2, PDF page 4, `rttt_architecture_source`. It preserves the original source asset and may annotate only RoboTTT architecture and long-context fast-weight update topology; callouts add no new quantities, topology, or causal claims.
- Primary delivery medium: `source asset`
- Recommended web medium: `source asset`
- Mobile, accessibility, and motion behavior: Keep the source asset unaltered at a readable intrinsic width inside a simple horizontally inspectable viewport on narrow screens.

### Implementation record

- Status: `IMPLEMENTED`
- Selected treatment: `A`
- Selection rationale: Treatment A uses the complete original source figure or figure set with exact provenance and no redraw; repeated placements reuse the same author-supplied assets.
- Delivery medium: `source asset`
- Visual ID and placement: `visual_robott_source_figure_2_change` — rendered immediately after `rttt_change_p2`.
- Shared paragraph scope: `rttt_change_p1`, `rttt_change_p2`
- Changed files: `packages/test-fixtures/explainers/robott.json`, `apps/web/public/paper-assets/robott/figure-2.png`, `apps/web/public/paper-assets/robott/figure-4.png`
- Accessibility and fallback verification: `VERIFIED IN FIXTURE` — every image has specific alt text; the visual retains equivalent fallback text, exact locator, attribution, license, and modification metadata.
- Desktop and mobile verification: `PENDING SITE INTEGRATION` — renderer and responsive browser QA are owned by `site_maintainer`.
- Evidence deviations: `NONE`

## `rttt_change_p2`

- Location: `rttt_change`, paragraph 2
- Text anchor: "The paper combines this state mechanism with two training ideas. Sequence action forcing samples"
- Claims and sources: `rttt_architecture`, `rttt_training`, `rttt_architecture_source`
- Visual needed: `YES`
- Complexity warrant: Non-trivial source-figure relationship — RoboTTT architecture, context scaling, and truncated-backpropagation boundary; prose would force readers to reconstruct the figure's linked components or quantitative structure.
- Forbidden-structure audit: `PASS`
- Source-figure audit: `USE_ORIGINAL`
- Original figure locator: Figures 2 and 4, PDF pages 4-5, `rttt_architecture_source`

### Treatment B — Original detail with context inset

- Teaching purpose: Show a legible detail while retaining the complete original as a context inset.
- Encoding and reading order: Read the enlarged source detail first, then use the inset to recover its exact position in the unmodified original.
- Evidence and limitations: Uses Figure 2, PDF page 4, `rttt_architecture_source`. It preserves the original source asset and may annotate only policy, context, and fast-weight update dependencies; callouts add no new quantities, topology, or causal claims.
- Primary delivery medium: `source asset`
- Recommended web medium: `source asset`
- Mobile, accessibility, and motion behavior: Keep the source asset unaltered at a readable intrinsic width inside a simple horizontally inspectable viewport on narrow screens. Make the viewport keyboard-focusable with a visible focus indicator and support horizontal inspection by arrow keys; show a visible mobile hint: “Swipe or use arrow keys to inspect the original figure.” Contain all horizontal overflow inside the figure viewport so the page itself never scrolls sideways. Preserve the original caption, exact locator, attribution, license, and equivalent text explanation. No motion.

### Treatment C — Original with numbered reading key

- Evidence and limitations: Uses Figure 2, PDF page 4, `rttt_architecture_source`. It preserves the original source asset and may annotate only policy, context, and fast-weight update dependencies; callouts add no new quantities, topology, or causal claims.

### Implementation record

- Status: `IMPLEMENTED`
- Selected treatment: `A`
- Selection rationale: Treatment A uses the complete original source figure or figure set with exact provenance and no redraw; repeated placements reuse the same author-supplied assets.
- Delivery medium: `source asset`
- Visual ID and placement: `visual_robott_source_figure_2_mechanism` — rendered immediately after `rttt_mechanism_p2`.
- Shared paragraph scope: `rttt_mechanism_p1`, `rttt_mechanism_p2`
- Changed files: `packages/test-fixtures/explainers/robott.json`, `apps/web/public/paper-assets/robott/figure-2.png`
- Accessibility and fallback verification: `VERIFIED IN FIXTURE` — every image has specific alt text; the visual retains equivalent fallback text, exact locator, attribution, license, and modification metadata.
- Desktop and mobile verification: `PENDING SITE INTEGRATION` — renderer and responsive browser QA are owned by `site_maintainer`.
- Evidence deviations: `NONE`

## `rttt_mechanism_p2`

- Location: `rttt_mechanism`, paragraph 2
- Text anchor: "At each step, projected keys and values define an inner loss. Gradient descent updates"
- Claims and sources: `rttt_architecture`, `rttt_training`, `rttt_architecture_source`, `rttt_training_source`
- Visual needed: `YES`
- Complexity warrant: Non-trivial source-figure relationship — policy, context, and fast-weight update dependencies; prose would force readers to reconstruct the figure's linked components or quantitative structure.
- Forbidden-structure audit: `PASS`
- Source-figure audit: `USE_ORIGINAL`
- Original figure locator: Figure 2, PDF page 4, `rttt_architecture_source`
- License and reuse status: `PERMITTED` — The arXiv v1 record identifies CC BY 4.0, while the PDF also carries an NVIDIA copyright notice; use the arXiv-licensed asset and preserve both the attribution and this recorded notice conflict.
- Decision rationale: The original figure directly performs this paragraph's explanatory job. Displaying it materially reduces reconstruction, while replacing it with a custom redraw would discard evidence-bearing structure and violate the source-first rule.
- Explanatory job: Inference-time inner-loop update, parallel pathways, and gated merge.

### Treatment A — Full original with focus frame

- Teaching purpose: Preserve the complete source figure and add one focus frame around the portion that answers this paragraph.
- Encoding and reading order: Read the untouched original first; the focus frame identifies the relevant region without suppressing its surrounding context.
- Evidence and limitations: Uses Figure 2, PDF page 4, `rttt_architecture_source`. It preserves the original source asset and may annotate only policy, context, and fast-weight update dependencies; callouts add no new quantities, topology, or causal claims.
- Primary delivery medium: `source asset`
- Recommended web medium: `source asset`
- Mobile, accessibility, and motion behavior: Keep the source asset unaltered at a readable intrinsic width inside a simple horizontally inspectable viewport on narrow screens.

### Treatment A — Full original with focus frame

- Teaching purpose: Preserve the complete source figure and add one focus frame around the portion that answers this paragraph.
- Encoding and reading order: Read the untouched original first; the focus frame identifies the relevant region without suppressing its surrounding context.
- Evidence and limitations: Uses Figure 7, PDF page 7, `rttt_results_source`. It preserves the original source asset and may annotate only real-robot evaluation on the paper's shared experimental frame; callouts add no new quantities, topology, or causal claims.
- Primary delivery medium: `source asset`
- Recommended web medium: `source asset`
- Mobile, accessibility, and motion behavior: Keep the source asset unaltered at a readable intrinsic width inside a simple horizontally inspectable viewport on narrow screens. Make the viewport keyboard-focusable with a visible focus indicator and support horizontal inspection by arrow keys; show a visible mobile hint: “Swipe or use arrow keys to inspect the original figure.” Contain all horizontal overflow inside the figure viewport so the page itself never scrolls sideways. Preserve the original caption, exact locator, attribution, license, and equivalent text explanation. No motion.

### Treatment B — Original detail with context inset

- Teaching purpose: Show a legible detail while retaining the complete original as a context inset.
- Encoding and reading order: Read the enlarged source detail first, then use the inset to recover its exact position in the unmodified original.
- Evidence and limitations: Uses Figure 7, PDF page 7, `rttt_results_source`. It preserves the original source asset and may annotate only real-robot evaluation on the paper's shared experimental frame; callouts add no new quantities, topology, or causal claims.

### Treatment C — Original with numbered reading key

- Teaching purpose: Keep the complete source figure and overlay a small numbered key that explains its paper-specific relationships.
- Encoding and reading order: Read the source figure in its own order; numbered callouts identify the evidence-bearing marks without redrawing them.
- Evidence and limitations: Uses Figure 7, PDF page 7, `rttt_results_source`. It preserves the original source asset and may annotate only real-robot evaluation on the paper's shared experimental frame; callouts add no new quantities, topology, or causal claims.

- Complexity warrant: NONE — prose is sufficient.
- Forbidden-structure audit: `NO_VISUAL`
- Source-figure audit: `NO_MATCH`
- Original figure locator: `NONE`
- License and reuse status: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — The paper's figures were checked; none directly performs this paragraph's explanatory job.
- Decision rationale: Perturbation recovery counts are comparable within condition, but only tire recovery includes the crucial GDN tie and DAgger's 33% effect belongs to a separate correction study. Combining them would imply one causal comparison; splitting roof, tire, and DAgger into tracks would create repeated metric panels. Prose keeps the shared 18/20 tire result adjacent to the limitation on fast-weight attribution.

- Decision rationale: This paragraph is a claim boundary rather than a reconstructive structure: The mechanism is well matched to the problem: recurrent fast weights provide a fixed-size state, while the scaling curve and component ablations connect longer training context and nonlinear fast models to better task completion on the evaluated setup. Keeping the qualifiers in prose avoids inventing causal links or turning heterogeneous caveats into interchangeable cards or a stock list.
- Explanatory job: Critical interpretation and claim boundary.
